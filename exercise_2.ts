// Given an array of URLs and a MAX_CONCURRENCY integer, implement a
// function that will asynchronously fetch each URL, not requesting
// more than MAX_CONCURRENCY URLs at the same time. The URLs should be
// fetched as soon as possible. The function should return an array of
// responses for each URL.

// How would you write a test for such a function?
